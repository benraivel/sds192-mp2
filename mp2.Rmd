## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, message=FALSE}
#Ooh ee ooh ah ah ting tang walla walla bing bang 123
library(tidyverse)
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```


```{r}
candidates <- candidates %>%
  rename("fec_id" = cand_id)
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
theFinalSet <- candidates %>%
  inner_join(house_elections, by = "fec_id") %>%
  select(fec_id, candidate_name, cand_party_affiliation, cand_office_state, incumbent, primary_votes, general_votes, ge_winner) %>%
  filter(primary_votes > 0) %>%
  filter(general_votes != 0)
contributionData <- contributions %>%
  select(cand_id, transaction_amt) %>%
  group_by(cand_id) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(transaction_amt), avg = mean(transaction_amt), number = n()) %>%
  filter(number != 0)
contributionData <- contributionData %>%
  rename("fec_id" = cand_id)

theFinalSet <- theFinalSet %>%
  inner_join(contributionData, by = "fec_id")
  
```

```{r}
theFinalSet %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total, y = general_votes)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = incumbent))
```
