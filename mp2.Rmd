## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, message=FALSE}
#Ooh ee ooh ah ah ting tang walla walla bing bang 123
library(tidyverse)
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```


```{r}
candidates <- candidates %>%
  rename("fec_id" = cand_id)
theFinalSet <- candidates %>%
  inner_join(house_elections, by = "fec_id")
```

```{r}
########################
#THIS IS THE CURRENT ONE 
########################
#theFinalSet <-
#  inner_join(candidates, house_elections, by = )
```
